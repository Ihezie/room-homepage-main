## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to use the Tailwind CSS library to make the process of styling my projects much faster and easier. I still have to practice using it a bit more, but I think I now have a good grasp of the library.

### Continued development
In future projects I plan to focus on increasing my efficiency and decreasing development time.
